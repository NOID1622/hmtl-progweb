        <td><b>Guts</b> <i>(stylized in all caps)</i> is the second studio album by the American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo, released on September 8, 2023, through Geffen Records. It was written and recorded with Rodrigo working closely alongside Dan Nigro, the producer and multi-instrumentalist of her debut album Sour (2021). Inspired by the period of time immediately following Sour's success, Rodrigo conceived Guts hoping to reflect the process of maturity she experienced toward the end of her teenage years.

            A sonically diverse pop record with energetic songs and soft ballads, Guts experiments with rock influences more than its predecessor, using a variety of guitar and drum sounds from alternative and pop rock styles. The subject matter deals with Rodrigo's transition from adolescence to adulthood and its tribulations. The album was met with widespread acclaim and praised by music critics for its lyrical wit, complexity, and topicality as well as the overall music aesthetic and energy. Reviews noted both humorous and emotionally fraught lyrics, detailing Rodrigo's struggles with identity, romantic and professional disillusionment, unexpected stardom, and societal expectations as a young woman.</td>
